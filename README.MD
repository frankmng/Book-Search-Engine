## Description

![MERN-BOOK-SEARCH](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/frankmng/Book-Search-Engine/blob/main/mern-book-search.png)


The Book Search Engine is a full-stack application built with the MERN stack, featuring a React-based front-end, a MongoDB database, and a Node.js/Express.js server and API. 

This application allows users to save their favorite books to the back end for easy access later. 

To power the book search functionality, the application utilizes the Google Books API search engine, which is integrated into the app using a GraphQL API and Apollo Server.
